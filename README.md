jquery-inline-editor
====================

A very simple inline editor


Based on the plugin jquery.editinplace which seems to be dead
http://code.google.com/p/jquery-in-place-editor/


Goals
====

Very simple plugin: switch an element content with an input, and return the new value with a callback.

That's it. No AJAX Saving BS, no animation BS.
